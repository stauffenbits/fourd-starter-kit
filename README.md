# fourd-starter-kit
An HTML5 starter kit for a page using FourD Graphs.

I just discovered this dead simple html5 boilerplate and decided to build a template repository for displaying 3D graphs. 

The steps are dead simple, as I said: 

```sh
git clone https://https://github.com/stauffenbits/fourd-starter-kit.git <your name for this project>
cd <same name>
npm install
npm start
```

You'll need Node.js and NPM installed, more [here](https://nodejs.org/).
